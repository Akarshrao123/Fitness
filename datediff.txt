/****** Script for SelectTopNRows command from SSMS  ******/
SELECT TOP (1000) [NBID]
      ,[Empcode]
      ,[Desig]
      ,[Dept]
      ,[Req]
      ,[Just]

      ,[otherstatusAE]
      ,[otherstatusFE]
      ,[DateCB]
  FROM [Internet_Reimbursement].[dbo].[Need_ReqEntry]
it have a column otherstatus which comes from 
this table 
SELECT TOP (1000) [id]
      ,[description]
      ,[st]
      ,[NextActionPendingWith]
  FROM [Internet_Reimbursement].[dbo].[Need_Status_MasterOther]
it have value 
id	description	st	NextActionPendingWith
0	Sent back to employee	1	NULL
2	Documents Submitted by Employee	1	Admin
4	Documents Approved by Admin	1	BCO
6	Approved and Closed by BCO	1	Closed
10	Updated Refund Details	1	NULL
12	Initiated Recovery from Salary	1	NULL
14	Updated Refund Details Approved by Admin	1	NULL
16	Initiated Recovery from Salary Approved by Admin	1	NULL
now i want to add flow that when employee is not submitting [Docfile1]
      ,[Docfile2]
      ,[Docfile3] till the 90 days after PaymentDate this NBID should have to go in admin buckets when documents are pending from employees









DECLARE @DocumentsPendingStatusID INT = (SELECT id FROM [Internet_Reimbursement].[dbo].[Need_Status_MasterOther] WHERE description = 'Documents Pending from Employee')

UPDATE [Internet_Reimbursement].[dbo].[Need_ReqEntry]
SET [Status] = @DocumentsPendingStatusID
WHERE DATEDIFF(day, [PaymentDate], GETDATE()) > 90
AND ([Docfile1] IS NULL OR [Docfile2] IS NULL OR [Docfile3] IS NULL)
AND [Status] != @DocumentsPendingStatusID; -- To avoid updating already marked as 'Documents Pending from Employee'
